# fft
DSA-course project which implements several Discrete Fourier Transform algorithms. 

The DFT implementations and tests are contained in the `fft` module. This is the important part regarding the DSA-course.

The desktop application is built on the [LibGDX game framework](https://libgdx.com/) to render the frequency decomposition of audio in real time. 
The implementation is in the `core` module.
